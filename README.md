# Realistic-Progression-STOCK---RP-1-With-Stock-system-OPM-and-MPE
Realistic Progression Stock is an experimental modification of RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) to convert the contracts from using RSS (Real Solar System) to make them use the stock system with OPM (Outer Planets Mod) and MPE (Minor Planets Expansion).

THIS MODIFICATION OF RP-1 (Realistic Progression One) IS EXPERIMENTAL - EXPECT BUGS - (As of writing this I have only minorly tested it. (16/10/25 EDIT: Came back to make this mod actually semi-playable still not tested contracting, but normal gameplay is better than it was, balancing should be fixed.))

IF YOU ENCOUNTER BUGS PLEASE REPORT THEM TO-[https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-Stock---Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1/issues](https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-STOCK---RP-1-With-Stock-system-OPM-and-MPE/issues)

This mod alters all Current RP-1 Contracts, Programmes and Newspaper to fit around the Stock Kerbol System (With OPM and MPE, Specifically at 10-10.625x scale, but smaller multipliers and the original stock system could work, Just may be unbalanced due to RO's Thrust to Weight ratios)

Currently all that has been done is the stock RP-1 (4.0.0.0 Experimental) contracts being converted to the Kerbol Systems counterparts (and where there isn't an counterpart I used a similar/fitting body either from the looks or size e.g. Tal from OPM)- NO CUSTOM CONTRACTS YET (as of RP-S v1.2)

THE MOD CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM HERE ---> [https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-Stock---Using-the-stock-solar-system-for-RP-1/releases](https://github.com/Waeferz/Realistic-Progression-STOCK---RP-1-With-Stock-system-OPM-and-MPE/releases)

As Stated before this mod of RP-1 requires OPM and MPE, It also Requires all the requirements of RP-1 and RO/RP-1 Express Install (Excluding RSS and Parallax 2.0 as Continued is more Optimised and Prettier for stock)

TO INSTALL, DELETE THE FOLDERS THAT ARE NAMED THE SAME AS THE FOLDERS IN THIS ZIP LOCATED IN ...Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\RP-1 THEN COPY OVER THE FOLDERS IN THE RP-S v1.2 FOLDER AND PLACE THEM IN the RP-1 FOLDER

IT IS ALSO ADVISED TO INSTALL THE PATCHES INCLUDED IF YOU WANT THE GAME TO FEEL PARTLY FINISHED. PATCHES INCLUDE:
Iodyne - Patches for Principia which I have edited to make all orbits 10x in Principia for 10x or 10.625x system with Prinicpia. To install just put folder into Gamedata.
Real Antennas - Added extra stations for better coverage over Kerbin (Still not the best). To install delete Real Antennas folder and place this one in.
True Volumetrics Patches - Contains altered clouds.cfg that extends scaledFadeStartAltitude and scaledFadeEndAltitude by 10x for alot better visuals, also increases cloud density. This is also done for OPM Volumetrics. To install place both folders (StockVolumetricClouds and OPMVolumetricClouds) into Gamedata and let it replace and files.
Parallax Continued Patches - A simple patch for ParallaxGlobalSettings.cfg which sets densityMultiplier and rangeMultiplier to 0.01 which prevents crashes when creating a save or loading a save. I reccomend setting them to 4 when loaded in to get scatters back.

If you want non-RP1 parts just delete the folder in RP-1 called "NonRP0.cfg".
