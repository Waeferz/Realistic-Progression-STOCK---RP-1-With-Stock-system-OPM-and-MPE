	description = The only known double planetary system in the Solar System, Plock and Karen have been tidally locked in orbit of each other in the darkest, coldest reaches of our system for eons. It is now time for you to land on them, quite possibly within a century of their discovery. Very little is known about these distant, icy worlds. Historically, even our most advanced probes have returned relatively little data compared to what we know about our closer neighbors. Explore the furthest reaches of the Kerbol System and land on this intriguing pair of dwarf planets.
